## Selecting things by their tag...

is fun, but not applicable in the real world. You will select things by their class name, id, attribute, etc.
In plain css, you might use something like [BEM](https://getbem.com/) or [CUBE](https://cube.fyi/) to create logical selectors by combining class names in some ways.

That's totally possible in surimi, but the cool thing is that you can just re-use your selectors. So your life get's even easier.

A simple example are child elements. Instead of creating "hierarchical" classes for them, just select them directly.

```ts
const heading = select('h1');
const span = heading.child('span');
```
Check the type hints: This selects `h1 > span`.
More realistically, with classes:

```ts
const heading = select('.blog-heading');
const span = heading.child('.blog-decoration');
```


and of course, this works with all other selectors.

```ts
const container = select('#root');
container.child('.my-content').hover().style({...});
container.child("button[disabled]:hover").style({...});
```
etc.
