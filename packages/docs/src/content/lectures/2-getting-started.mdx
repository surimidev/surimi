## How to... style things.


Simple: You use the `select` function to select something, and then call `style()` on it with the styles you want.

```ts
const button = select('button');
```

gives you a selector with a loooot of methods on it. For now, just call `.style()` and pass an object with styles. Like this:

```ts
button.style({
  backgroundColor: 'blue',
  color: 'white',
});
```

In contrast to some other css-in-js libraries, surimi does not generate any class names for you (by default). Instead, you simply write any css selectors, like you would in vanilla css.

Check out the type hint for the `button selector` in the editor. It's typed as `SelectorBuilder<'button'>`. What does that mean?
It's a builder because it has the entire CSS spec baked in as a functional API. That means you can access all the CSS features just by chaining methods, declaring variables etc.

What if we want a button that's only colored when it's hovered?

```ts
button.hover().style({
  backgroundColor: 'blue',
  color: 'white',
});
```

And now the cool part: Surimi knows what you're selecting. So if you're at any point unsure what surimi code does, just hover over it and you'll see. In our case: `SelectorBuilder<"button:hover">`.
