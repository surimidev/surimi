## Welcome to Surimi!

Surimi is a powerful CSS-in-TypeScript library that allows you to write type-safe, re-usable styles with typescript.
It is meant as a modern alternative to CSS preprocessors. It has the entire css specification baked in, shown to you as type hints, and because it's just typescript,
you don't have to re-learn anything.

## What you'll learn

In the next couple of (super quick) lectures, you'll go from the basics of Surimi to mastering it. It's super easy, so it'll only take a few minutes.
If you want to see the documentation or learn how it all works, check out the [How It works](/docs/how-it-works) section of the docs.

## Let's do this!

Click the "next" button below to get started, or just play around on this page for a while.

You can only use the surimi package right now. The editor might show you type hints for other packages, but the'll not be installed.
