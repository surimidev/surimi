# Guides Overview

This section contains various guides on how to use Surimi with different tools and frameworks.
While we currently only test Surimi with Vite, it can be used with any bundler or framework with a simple plugin.

If you need help getting started with a specific tool or framework, please open an issue or submit a pull request to add a guide for it!

## Vite
Vite is the recommended setup to use with Surimi. It provides a fast development server and build times, SSR/SSG support, fast HMR, and a rich plugin ecosystem.
Check out the [Using with Vite](/docs/guides/vite) guide to get started.

## Astro
Astro is a modern static site generator that supports multiple frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte etc.
It is built on top of Vite, so using Surimi with Astro is very similar to using it with Vite.
You can use the vite plugin as described in the [Using with Vite](/docs/guides/vite) guide.

## Rolldown/Rollup
If you are using Rollup or Rolldown as your bundler, you can use the `@surimi/compiler` package directly to compile your `.css.ts` files.
Check out the [API reference for the compiler](/docs/reference/compiler) for more information on how to use it
