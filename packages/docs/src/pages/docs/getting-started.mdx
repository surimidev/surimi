Welcome to Surimi! This guide is a quick guide to get you started with Surimi. For a more in-depth explaination of Surimi's concepts, check out the [How it works](/docs/how-it-works) section.

Surimi is a TS-in-CSS library to write type-safe, zero-runtime CSS in typescript. It is meant as a modern, hybrid approach between CSS preprocessors like SCSS and CSS-in-JS libraries like Vanilla Extract.

## Installation

Install Surimi with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm install -D surimi
# or
yarn add -D surimi
# or
pnpm add -D surimi
```

Next, you will need to run the surimi compiler somehow. While you can do that manually through the `@surimi/compiler` package, we recommend using the vite plugin.

```bash
npm install -D vite-plugin-surimi
# or
yarn add -D vite-plugin-surimi
# or
pnpm add -D vite-plugin-surimi
```

Note that both are installed as dev dependencies, as they are only needed at build time. Surimi does not (currently) need any runtime.
