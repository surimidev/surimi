Welcome to Surimi! This is a quick guide to get you started with Surimi. For a more in-depth explaination of Surimi's concepts, check out the [How it works](/docs/how-it-works) section.

Surimi is a TS-in-CSS library to write type-safe, zero-runtime CSS in typescript. It is meant as a modern, hybrid approach between CSS preprocessors like SCSS and CSS-in-JS libraries like Vanilla Extract.

> [!NOTE]
> Surimi is still in early development. The API might change, and some features are not yet implemented.
> If you have feedback or issues, open an issue on [GitHub](surimidev/surimi)

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> If you use tools like Vite, Astro etc., have a look at our [Guides Overview](/docs/guides/overview) for specific setup instructions.

Install Surimi with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm install -D surimi
# or
yarn add -D surimi
# or
pnpm add -D surimi
```


Next, you need to run the surimi compiler. While you could do that manually through the `@surimi/compiler` package, we recommend using the vite plugin.
It will automatically compile your `.css.ts` files on change, and integrate with your build tool to include the generated CSS in your final bundle.
It supports all vite-compatible frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, Astro etc. with configuration options for custom requirements.

### Installation of the Vite plugin

```bash
npm install -D vite-plugin-surimi
# or
yarn add -D vite-plugin-surimi
# or
pnpm add -D vite-plugin-surimi
```

Note that both are installed as dev dependencies, as they are only needed at build time. Surimi does not (currently) need any runtime.

Now, add the plugin to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import surimi from 'vite-plugin-surimi';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [surimi()],
});
```

Again, for more details on the vite plugin see [Using Surimi with Vite](/docs/guides/vite).

## Usage

Create a `.css.ts` file somewhere in your project, e.g. `src/styles.css.ts`:

```ts
import { select } from 'surimi';

select('body').style({
  margin: 0,
  backgroundColor: 'coral',
});
```

And import that file somewhere in your app, e.g. in `src/main.ts` or `src/App.tsx`:

```ts
import './styles.css';
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note, that we left out the `.ts` extension from the import.
> This is because by default, vite and typescript are setup to resolve the extension automatically. Depending on your setup, you might need to include it.

:tada: And that's it! The Surimi file will be automatically compiled (with HMR support), and exports from the file will be preserved (With some [exceptions](/docs/compiler#limitations)).

## What surimi offers now:

- Type-safe, autocompleted CSS properties and values
- Hints when hovering over properties, selectors and values
  - It will even tell you what you're targetting, like
  ```
  SelectorBuilder<"body > #container .button:hover">
  ```
- A query-builder API to build complex selectors
- Support for media queries, pseudo selectors, nesting and more
- Zero runtime, all CSS is compiled away
- Full integration with your build tool via the vite plugin
